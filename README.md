# Data-Structures
Data Structures in C are used to store data in an organised and efficient manner. The C Programming language has many data structures like an array, stack, queue, linked list, tree, etc. A programmer selects an appropriate data structure and uses it according to their convenience.

## Objective:
To implement different operations on data structures and also study time complexity of different sorting techniques in best and worst cases-
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Create
* Traverse
* Sorting

## Data Structure:
1.  [Array](array.c "Click to redirect to c program") 
2.  [Binary Search tree](bst.c "Click to redirect to c program") :
    > Using linklist
    * traveral in level order
    * traversal in specific order -pre,post,in
    * counting leaf nodes
    * counting internal nodes
    * hieght of tree
3.  [Graph](graph.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > Using linklist and 2Darray
    * depth for search
    * breadth for search
4.  [Link List](link.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > Using structure
5.  [Stack and Queue](linkq.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > Using linklist
6.  [Merge and Quick sort](merge.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > Using array
    * Quick sort with last pivot
    * Quick sort with first pivot
7.  [Merge two array](mergemergetwoarraysort.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > arrange them in ascending order
8.  [Stack using Queue and Queue using Stack](que.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > using array
9.  [search in linklist](searchinlinklist.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > using structure
10. [Sorting](sorting.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > using array
    *   bubble sort
    *   selection sort
    *   insertion sort
    *   shell sort
    *   bucket sort
11. [Stack,Circular queue and Queue](stackq.c "Click to redirect to c program"):
    > using array
12. [tree](tree.c "Click to redirect to c program") :
    > Using linklist and array
    * traveral in level order
    * traversal in specific order -pre,post,in
    * counting leaf nodes
    * counting internal nodes
    * hieght of tree
